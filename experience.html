        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h4>Small Business Apparel Company</h4>
        <p>February 2022 to Present</p>
        <p>Since I work at a small business, I have a few job titles/responsiblities. I mainly manage customer's orders, so I would pick out all the items, package, and then create the labels to ship each order. However,
          I have been able to learn new skills to help the business grow and gain some cool pointers to add to my future resume! 
        </p>
        <p>I also took on this job because I wanted to help them revamp their website when I had the necessary skillsets to make it even cooler than it already is. It may not seem like much, but I feel as though this job has encouraged me 
          to continue my pursue for a career in the tech industry. I am determined to make it worthwhile.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience (Continued)</h2>
        <h4>Appliance Company</h4>
        <p>October 2020 to April 2021</p>
        <p>I worked as a salesperson selling home appliances that ranged from:</p>
          <ul class="appliance">
          <li>Laundry Machines</li>
          <li>Ranges/Stovetops</li>
          <li>Refrigerator</li>
          <li>Mattresses</li>
          <li>And More!</li>
          </ul>
        <p>This allowed me to work on my customer service skills, and I was able to learn how to problem solve when it came to fulfilling the needs of my clients.</p>
