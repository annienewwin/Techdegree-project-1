        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a student at CSULB that is trying to find a career that would make me feel fulfilled and happy! I am currently taking time off traditional school because I wanted to see if I could make it as a Front End Developer. I hope that I am able to complete this course and prove to myself that I can do it!</p>
        <p>Besides being a student, I am working part-time with a small business in hopes that I can revamp their website when I am fully equipped with the necessary skills. Also, I am a hobby artist! All the pictures on my home page were drawn by me through procreate.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal is to be able to design amazing websites that are professional, yet have their own character when viewed. I hope to expand my knowledge in the following areas:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          
        </ul>
        <p>I always say that my end goal would be to work with Google, and I don't mind if that seems too ambitious. However, I want to be apart of a large company and make a difference in some shape or way. </p>
